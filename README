The main purpose is to improve clang_complete to make it works with latest
clang and ensure it works for gvim on windows as well as on linux.
The verified workable solution is:
gvim 7.3 + clang 3.1(with MSVC2010 built libclang.dll) + plugins in this branch

This plugin uses clang for accurately completing C and C++ code.

To build and install in one step, type:
$ make install

To build and install in two steps, type:
$ make
$ vim clang_complete.vmb -c 'so %' -c 'q'

Alternatively, you can also put the files in ~/.vim/

You need Vim 7.3 or higher, compiled with python support and ideally, with
the conceal feature.

See doc/clang_complete.txt for help and license.
